# FacebookPostsRetriever
pulling facebook group posts with node and scraping them for further metadata with 


## Issues
- A forseeable problem with this method is that the facebook pulling works off of my facebook account. I don't know if pulling from your account will work. 
- Also, because I'm an admin of the main group that I'm pulling data from, I have cart blanche access to it. Let me know if errors occur and I'll make you an admin ( although I think you are)


## Installation 
- run "npm install" 
- run "node init.js" or "nodemon" 
-- IF you run "nodemon", be careful because the process will keep looping
